# Thymol enhanced Spring PetClinic + Thymeleaf Sample Application

## What's this?
This is the thymeleaf-enabled version of the Spring PetClinic official
sample application by SpringSource copied from the Thymeleaf project, but with additional JavaScript files that implement a Thymol emulation of the main functions of the web application.

The original application lives at https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-petclinic

The Thymeleaf version can be found at https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleafexamples-petclinic

## Running the Thymol petclinic project locally

First, you will have to download the project. If you have a local installation of git, you can simply clone this repository:

```
	git clone https://github.com/thymol/thymol.thymeleafexamples-petclinic.git
```

If you don't have git installed, you can download a `.zip` by pressing on the 
*Download zip* button on the right-hand side of this page.

Once downloaded, simply use your web browser to load the following file from your local file system:
```
	<path-to-project>/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/thymeleaf/welcome.html
```   
Where "&lt;path-to-project&gt;" is the directory in which you cloned or unzipped the repository.
